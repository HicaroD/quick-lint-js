# E0719: unexpected 'await' keyword on function declaration

For defining asynchronous functions, you need to explicitly annotate a
function with `async` keyword, not `await`.

```javascript
await function f() {};
```

To fix this warning, simply replace 'await' by 'async'. Now, you have an
asynchronous and you're able to use 'await' inside this function.

```javascript
async function f() {}
```
